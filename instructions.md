Agent: I'll check the weather for you. [Shows weather information]
```

**File Operations:**
```
You: Create a file called notes.txt with some meeting notes
Agent: I'll create a file with meeting notes for you. Would you like me to proceed? (Y/N)
```

**Web Searches:**
```
You: Find information about AI agents
Agent: I'll search the web for information about AI agents. Would you like me to proceed? (Y/N)
```

**Complex Tasks:**
```
You: Find a logo for my startup called "TechFlow"
Agent: I'll help you find a logo for TechFlow. This involves:
1. Searching for logo designs
2. Downloading suitable options
3. Organizing them in a folder
Would you like me to proceed? (Y/N)
```

6. **Learning and Adaptation**
   - Learns from every interaction
   - Improves performance over time
   - Adapts to your preferences
   - Prevents repeated errors

### What Makes It "Real"

Unlike simple chatbots, this agent:

- **Actually understands** what you're asking for
- **Remembers context** across conversations
- **Learns from experience** and improves
- **Performs real actions** (not just talks about them)
- **Handles errors intelligently** and recovers automatically
- **Integrates with real services** (Gmail, Stripe, etc.)
- **Adapts to your preferences** and work style

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Required:**
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: For Gemini AI access
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For OpenAI services
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: For DeepSeek and other models

**Optional (for enhanced features):**
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: For payment processing
- `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`: For weather information
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`: For maps and directions
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` & `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: For Gmail and Calendar

### Policy Configuration

The `policy.yaml` file controls what the agent can do:

```yaml
profiles:
  dev:
    description: "Development profile - minimal permissions"
    allow:
      - llm.call
      - file.read
      - file.write
    
  research:
    description: "Research profile - web access and file operations"
    allow:
      - llm.call
      - web.get
      - file.read
      - file.write
      - file.download
    
  admin:
    description: "Admin profile - full access with confirmations"
    allow:
      - "*"  # All tools
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Module not found" errors:**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**API key errors:**
- Check that your `.env` file exists and contains valid API keys
- Ensure API keys have the necessary permissions
- Verify API quotas haven't been exceeded

**Permission errors:**
- Check the security profile settings
- Use `python src/main.py approve` to approve pending actions
- Switch to a more permissive profile if needed

**Browser automation issues:**
- Ensure Playwright browsers are installed: `playwright install`
- Check that the system has display access (for non-headless mode)

### Getting Help

1. **Check the logs**: The agent provides detailed logging
2. **Review audit trail**: `python src/main.py audit`
3. **Check system status**: `python src/main.py status`
4. **Reset to defaults**: Delete the `data/` directory to reset

## üéØ Best Practices

### Effective Communication

1. **Be specific**: "Find a logo for my startup" vs "Find a logo"
2. **Provide context**: "Move the file I just downloaded" (agent remembers)
3. **Use natural language**: No need for special commands
4. **Confirm actions**: The agent will ask before doing anything risky

### Security

1. **Start with 'dev' profile**: Minimal permissions for safety
2. **Review audit logs**: Regularly check what the agent has done
3. **Use confirmations**: Always confirm before allowing sensitive actions
4. **Keep API keys secure**: Don't share your `.env` file

### Performance

1. **Let it learn**: The agent improves with use
2. **Provide feedback**: Tell it when it does something well or poorly
3. **Use context**: Reference previous conversations
4. **Be patient**: Complex tasks may take time

## üîÆ Advanced Usage

### Custom Workflows

The agent can create and execute complex workflows:

```
You: Create a workflow that checks my email, summarizes important messages, and creates calendar events for meetings
Agent: I'll create a workflow for email processing and calendar management. This involves:
1. Connecting to your email
2. Analyzing message content
3. Extracting meeting information
4. Creating calendar events
Would you like me to set this up? (Y/N)
```

### Background Tasks

The agent can run tasks in the background:

```
You: Monitor my inbox every hour and alert me to urgent messages
Agent: I'll set up a background task to monitor your email. This will run every hour and notify you of urgent messages.
```

### Integration Examples

**Email Management:**
```
You: Send an email to john@example.com about our meeting tomorrow
Agent: I'll compose and send an email about tomorrow's meeting. Would you like me to proceed? (Y/N)
```

**Calendar Management:**
```
You: Schedule a meeting with the team for next Tuesday at 2 PM
